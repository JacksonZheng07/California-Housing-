# Housing Price Prediction: From NumPy to PyTorch Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains two linear regression projects predicting housing prices:

1. **NumPy Implementation:**  
   A from-scratch linear regression model built using only NumPy. This project manually implements gradient descent and demonstrates the mathematical foundations of linear regression without using deep learning libraries.

2. **PyTorch Implementation:**  
   A multivariable linear regression model built using PyTorch. This project leverages PyTorch's automatic differentiation and optimization features to train a model on the California Housing dataset.

Both projects cover data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Datasets Used

- **California Housing Dataset:** Used in the PyTorch project; contains numeric features such as average rooms, house age, median income, and geographical coordinates to predict median house prices.
